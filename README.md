# Bezel-Engine-Archive .bea Library/Editor
A libary aimed to rebuild, add, and remove files in a bezel engine archive file (.bea)
Editor also included.

## Credits
Libary
- Syroot for binary data IO and additional features. 
- Aluigi (Bms script to reference a little bit of the layout)
- Leoetlino (helped with dictionary generation)

Feel free to use this library for other projects. Credit would be appreciated if used! 

Tool
- Exelix (Sarc lib for some functions)
- [ZstdNet (Compression)](https://github.com/skbkontur/ZstdNet)
- Be.HexEditor by Bernhard Elbl
- [Treeview Icons by icons8](https://icons8.com/)

## Usage
- Open Bezel Engine Archive Editor and open a .bea file. From there you can extract the whole thing to a folder, extract and replace individual files, and repack the extracted folder, then File -> Save to save the .bea back. Atm this only replaces, however the lib can add/remove files so it'll be added in soon.
